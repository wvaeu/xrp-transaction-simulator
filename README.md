# xrp-transaction-simulator
A beginner's simulation of some crypto basics

## Introduction
This is my attempt at creating an XRP transaction simulator using newfound basics from my intro to programming class. My goal with this project is to become more familiar with my class learnings and blockchain technology while also creating a program that could teach fellow kinaesthetic learners some basic crypto concepts. 

## Concepts Illustrated
By tinkering with my program you will hopefully learn:
* The difference between private and public keys 
* How hashes and previous hashes are used when writing to a ledger
* A sense of the USD/XRP exchange rate and how they affect transactions 

## What's in this folder
* Ledger.py: A class object that simulates how writing to a blockchain works 
* Account.py: A class object that simulates a crypto wallet 
* Application.py: The program to run the simulation 
* XRP-test-accounts.txt: A text file that contains test accounts generated with [Ripple](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html)
* XRP-ledger.txt: A text file that simulates the public blockchain and a ledger of all the transactions 

## How to run the application 
1. Login using an account (private key) located in XRP-test-accounts.txt
2. If you want to send XRP, choose another account and different public key (using XRP-test-accounts.txt)
3. Play around with menu items 

## Disclaimer 
I'm definitely a rookie when it comes to programming and blockchain so please feel free to offer code suggestions or let me know if I've misrepresented a crypto concept.

I'm in the middle of exam period but I like to call this productive procrastination… 🥳
